## Notes for Future Developers

### Animation System Architecture
The animation system is designed with modularity and maintainability in mind:

#### Key Files and Their Purposes
- **`/src/utils/animations.js`**: Central animation library with reusable variants
- **Component files**: Individual animation implementations for specific UI elements
- **`/src/components/SmoothScrollProvider.jsx`**: Scroll behavior management
- **Tailwind config**: Hardware acceleration and animation utilities

#### Extending the Animation System
When adding new animations:
1. **Check existing variants first**: Many common animations already exist in the utils library
2. **Follow naming conventions**: Use descriptive names like `slideInFromLeft` not `animation1`
3. **Include accessibility considerations**: Always provide reduced motion alternatives
4. **Test performance impact**: Monitor frame rates when adding complex animations

#### Common Animation Patterns Used
```javascript
// Standard entrance animation
const standardEntrance = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 50 },
  visible: { 
    opacity: 1, 
    y: 0,
    transition: { duration: 0.6, ease: "easeOut" }
  }
};

// Hover interaction pattern
const standardHover = {
  scale: 1.05,
  boxShadow: "0 10px 25px rgba(20, 184, 166, 0.2)",
  transition: { type: "spring", stiffness: 300 }
};
```

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

#### Critical Performance Rules
1. **Use hardware acceleration**: Always include `will-change` for transformed elements
2. **Limit concurrent animations**: No more than 5 complex animations simultaneously
3. **Optimize for mobile**: Test on actual devices, not just browser simulation
4. **Monitor memory usage**: Check for animation-related memory leaks in long sessions

#### Animation Performance Checklist
- [ ] Animations use `transform` and `opacity` properties when possible
- [ ] Complex animations include `will-change` declarations
- [ ] Viewport-based triggers prevent off-screen animations
- [ ] Reduced motion alternatives are implemented
- [ ] Frame rate remains above 55fps on target devices

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Animation Not Triggering
**Common Causes**:
- Viewport detection threshold too high/low
- Component not properly wrapped with motion element
- Animation variant not properly defined
- CSS conflicts with animation properties

**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check browser console for Framer Motion warnings
